# CHI Arrests: An Deep Learning Analysis of Ciminal Arrests in Chicago

### PROJECT TOPIC

The City of Chicago was in the national US news a lot in 2025, specifically as a potential target for crime-fighting intervention by Federal troops. Irrespective of any assessment of the potential effectiveness of such an intervention, one fact is undisputed by people across the political spectrum: Chicago has a crime "problem."

This problem is most ccommonly charcterized by critics of the city in terms of it's homicides. For example, the US administration based part of its case for intervention on a 2024 study that revealed that Chicago had both the highest overall number of homicides for any city (573), and the highest murder rate (21.7 per 100,000) of any city with over 1 million people.(1)

Beyond the headline murder numbers, though, Chicago has a problem not just with crime, but with arrests. Arrest rates have been steadily declining over the last two decades, to the point that, in 2024, an arrest was made for only 1 out every 7 violent crimes committed in the City.(2)

Many causes have been proffered for this decline: a shrinking police force, a reduction on overtime hours, restrictions on police tactics, rising community mistrust of authorities, etc.

My project seeks to answer the following questions through deep learning: What can we learn simply by looking at the crime and arrest data? Is it possible to predict whether or not a crime will lead to an arrest? What are the important factors? And can we extrapolate possible interventions?
